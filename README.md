# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Constructed a MATLAB code using Machine learning/Deep learning which is efficient for image recognition systems.
The application is to find the hand gesture which is captured dynamically. Those will be matched with a stored library of static hand gesture images.
/*
The repository also contains data set folder as well as a pre trained neural network but its size is <<100MB
So they are not uploaded here.
